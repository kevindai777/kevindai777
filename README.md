Hello ðŸ˜„! My name is Kevin Dai, and I'm currently a programmer looking for the next big opportunity. You'll find that I have a large passion for learning and studying about algorithms on my page (as seen with the unholy number of LeetCode repositories I've posted ðŸ¤”). In my free time I love teaching, and run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYIqMHpAuKkUz3Z--KJHqQ), dedicated to me explaining my approach to various coding questions.

<br>

Here's a little more about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating new visual content for my Youtube channel! I'm also determined to make an application that gives strong visuals on data structures and algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Graph Theory! The book I'm using is 'Introduction to Graph Theory' by R. Trudeau
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kevin.dai.2451@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play the piano in my free time! My favorite composer is Chopin, and my favorite piece is his Ballade No. 1 in G Minor
