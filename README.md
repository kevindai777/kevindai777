Hello ðŸ˜„! My name is Kevin Dai, and I'm currently a programmer looking for the next big opportunity. You'll find that I have a large passion for learning and studying about algorithms on my page (as seen with the unholy number of LeetCode repositories I've posted...) I also love teaching on the side, and have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYIqMHpAuKkUz3Z--KJHqQ) dedicated to me talking about my approach to different coding questions.
